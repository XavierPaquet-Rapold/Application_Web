# Change Log

## Version 9.1.0 (2021-03-17)

## Existing API updates

* **Payments API:**
  * [CreatePayment](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-03-17/payments-api/create-payment). Until now, the `CreatePayment` endpoint supported only taking card payments. In this release, the API now supports cash and external payments. For more information, see [Take Payments.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments)
  * [UpdatePayment](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-03-17/payments-api/update-payment). This new  endpoint enables developers to change the payment amount and tip amount after a payment is created. For more information, see [Update Payments.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/update-payments)
 
* **Invoices API:**
  * [InvoiceDeliveryMethod](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-03-17/enums/InvoiceDeliveryMethod) enum. Added the read-only `SMS` value.  
  * [InvoiceRequestMethod](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-03-17/enums/InvoiceRequestMethod)Â enum (deprecated). Added the read-only `SMS`, `SMS_CHARGE_CARD_ON_FILE`, and `SMS_CHARGE_BANK_ON_FILE` values for backward compatibility.  
  
  These values direct Square to send invoices and receipts to customers using SMS (text message). SMS settings can be configured from first-party Square applications only; they cannot be configured from the Invoices API. Square does not send invoice reminders when using SMS to communicate with customers.


* **Terminal API:**
  * [TerminalCheckout](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-03-17/objects/TerminalCheckout). Previously, `TerminalCheckout` only supported tapped, dipped, or swiped credit cards. It now supports manual card entry and e-money. Added the `payment_type` field to denote a request for a manually entered payment card or an e-money payment.
  * [TerminalCheckoutPaymentType.](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-03-17enums/TerminalCheckoutPaymentType) A new enum for the Terminal checkout payment types that can be requested.
  * [E-money support](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/terminal-api/e-money-payments) is now available for Terminal checkout requests in Japan.


## SDKs
* **Square Java SDK:**
  * Updated the OkHttp dependency to version 4.9.0.
  * Fixed a `NullPointerException` when passing an empty order ID to the `UpdateOrder` method.

## Documentation updates

* **Multi-language code examples.** Previously, various topics showed only cURL examples for the REST API operations. These topics now show examples in multiple languages. You can use the language drop-down list to choose a language.
  
* [When to Use Connect V1.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/using-connect-v1) Content is revised to reflect the most current information about when to use the Connect V1 API.


## Version 9.0.0 (2021-02-26)
## Existing API updates

* **Customers API:**

## SDKs

* **All Square SDKs:**

    By default, all SDKs send requests to Square's production (https://connect.squareup.com) or sandbox (https://connect.squareupsandbox.com) hosts based on the client's `environment` parameter.

    You now have the option to use a custom URL instead. To use a custom URL, follow the example for your language to set the `environment` parameter to `custom` and the `customUrl` parameter to your URL:

    - Java

      ```java
      new SquareClient.Builder()
        .environment(Environment.CUSTOM)
        .customUrl("https://example.com")
      ```

    - .NET

      ```csharp
      new Square.SquareClient.Builder()
        .Environment(Environment.Custom)
        .CustomUrl("https://example.com")
      ```

    - Node.js

      ```javascript
      new Client({
        environment: Environment.Custom,
        customUrl: 'https://example.com'
      });
      ```

    - PHP

      ```php
      new Square\SquareClient([
        'environment' => Environment::CUSTOM,
        'customUrl' => 'https://example.com',
      ]);
      ```

    - Python

      ```python
      Client(
        environment = 'custom',
        custom_url = 'https://example.com',)
      ```

    - Ruby

      ```ruby
      Square::Client.new(
        environment: 'custom',
        custom_url: 'https://example.com'
      });
      ```


* **Square .NET SDK:**

  Square has overridden the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods for models:

  * In the `Equals` override, Square has implemented a field-level comparison.
  * The Square `GetHashCode` override now ensures that hashes are deterministic and unique for each object.

* **Square Node.js SDK:**

  Endpoints that return 64-bit integers now return a `BigInt` object instead of a `Number` object.


* **Connect Node.js SDK:** (deprecated)

  The deprecated Connect Node.js SDK is in the security [maintenance state.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/api-lifecycle#maintenance) It does not receive any bug fixes or API updates from the Square version 2021-02-26 release. However, the SDK will receive support and security patches until it is retired (end of life) in the second quarter of 2021. For more information, including steps for migrating to the [Square Node.js SDK,](https://github.com/square/square-nodejs-sdk) see the [Connect SDK README.](https://github.com/square/connect-nodejs-sdk/blob/master/README.md)

## Documentation updates
* **Catalog API:**
  * [Update Catalog Objects.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/update-catalog-objects) Provides programming guidance to update catalog objects.

* **Inventory API:**
  * [List or retrieve inventory.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/migrate-from-v1/guides/v1-items#list-or-retrieve-inventory) Migrate the retired v1 endpoint of `ListInventory` to the v2 endpoint of `BatchRetrieveInventoryCounts`. Compare and contrast the programming patterns between the v1 endpoint of `ListInventory` and its v2 counterparts of [BatchRetrieveInventoryCounts](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-02-26/inventory-api/batch-retrieve-inventory-counts) or [RetrieveInventoryCount](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-02-26/inventory-api/retrieve-inventory-count).
  * [Adjust or change inventory.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/migrate-from-v1/guides/v1-items#adjust-or-change-inventory) Migrate the retired v1 endpoint of `AdjustInventory` to the v2 endpoint of `BatchChangeInventory`. Compare and contrast the programming patterns between the v1 endpoint of `AdjustInventory` and its v2 counterparts of [BatchChangeInventory](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-02-26/inventory-api/batch-change-inventory).

* **Get Started topic.** Revised the [Get Started](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/get-started) experience. In addition to clarifications, it now includes the use of the Square Sandbox and API Explorer. These are the tools and environments developers use to explore Square APIs.


## Version 8.1.1 (2021-01-27T00:00)
## SDKs
* Fixed Node.js test `testCreateInvoice`. Uses `Invoice.delivery_method` instead of deprecated field `InvoicePaymentRequest.request_method`

## Version 8.1.0 (2021-01-21T00:00)
## Existing API updates

* **Invoices API:** (beta)

  The `InvoicePaymentRequest.request_method` field is deprecated, and its current options are separated into two new fields that better represent their scope:
  * `Invoice.delivery_method` specifies how Square should send invoices, reminders, and receipts to the customer.
  * `InvoicePaymentRequest.automatic_payment_source` specifies the payment method for an automatic payment.

  As part of this change, the [InvoiceDeliveryMethod](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/enums/InvoiceDeliveryMethod) and [InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/enums/InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource) enums are added and the `InvoiceRequestMethod` enum is deprecated.

  The Invoices API will continue to accept `request_method`Â in create and update requests until the field is retired, but starting in this version, `request_method` is not included in returned `Invoice` objects. For more information, see the [migration notes.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#migrate-InvoicePaymentRequest.request_method)


* **Locations API:**
  * The [Locations.MCC](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/objects/Location#definition__property-mcc) field is now updatable (beta). You can use the `UpdateLocation` endpoint to update the merchant category code (MCC) associated with a seller location. For more information, see [Initialize a merchant category code.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#initialize-a-merchant-category-code)




## SDKs
* **Connect Node.js SDK:** (deprecated)

  The deprecated Connect Node.js SDK is in the security [maintenance state.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/api-lifecycle#maintenance) It will not receive any bug fixes or API updates from the Square version 2021-01-21 release. However, the SDK will receive support and security patches until it is retired (EOL) in Q2, 2021. For more information, including steps for migrating to the [Square Node.js SDK,](https://github.com/square/square-nodejs-sdk) see the [Connect SDK README.](https://github.com/square/connect-nodejs-sdk/blob/master/README.md)

## Documentation updates
* **Catalog API:**
  * The [Use Item Options to Manage Item Variations](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/item-options-migration) topic is added. It demonstrates how item variations are usually used and how item options can be used to enable random access to item variations.

* **Inventory API:**
  * The [Inventory API](inventory-api/what-it-does) content is updated. It provides clearer guidance about how to use the API, with a task-oriented TOC and improved code examples.
